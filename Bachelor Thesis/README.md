### Bachelor Thesis "Extending the Ability to Diagnose Data Missingness Mechanism through Machine Learning"
**Brief description:** It is important to select the appropriate method for working with the data to draw accurate conclusions. Missing data mechanisms, such as MCAR, MAR, and MNAR, are used for this purpose to determine how to handle these omissions. Diagnosing the missing data mechanism enables researchers to decide whether to ignore or impute the missing data, depending on whether the missing data are random or not. While ignorable MCAR or MAR gaps can be omitted from the analysis, non-ignorable MNAR gaps cannot be. However, a challenge arises in distinguishing between ignorable and non-ignorable missing data within the data collected by the researcher (Resseguier, Giorgi, Paoletti, 2011). The purpose of this work is to find out whether it is possible to use the machine learning methods for diagnosis of missing data mechanisms.
